### Delirium

In the SAGES study, delirium is assessed through direct interview with patients, family and caregiver interview, and medical chart review. Delirium can be defined at the patient-interview-level using the confusion assessment (CAM) algorithm, or at a daily or visit level using chart data and family interview. 

**We recommend the variable `vdsagesdeliriumever` as the main delirium outcome variable.** This variable can be found in the `SAGES-Delirium-Assessments-Analysis-File` data file and has the label: _Ever Delirious in Hospital by Interview OR Chart_. This variable can take on three valid values: 0 (No), 1 (subsyndromal), and 2 (Yes). Oftentimes in data analysis steps, a binary version of this variable is created that groups patients without delirium (0/No) and subsyndromal delirium (1).
