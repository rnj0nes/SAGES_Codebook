### Delirium Severity

The recommended delirium severity measures are `vdcamseverity_peak` or `vdcamseverity_sum`. The *peak* and the *sum* provide the maximum or the total of all in-hospital CAM-S delirium severity scores for a given participant. Some of us prefer the *peak* because the *sum* can be high for persons with low and/or mild delirium, perhaps never meeting CAM criteria for delirium, but with a long stay. However, in our validation analyses (see Vasunilashorn et al 2016), the *sum* slightly out-performed the *peak*. Fans of the *peak* are unswayed because the clinical outcomes against which the various severity measures were validated against in Vasunilashort et al (2016) could capitalize on confounding due to dementia.
